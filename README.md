# üçÇ Potato Disease Classification using CNN

This project focuses on **classifying potato leaf diseases** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The model is trained to identify three categories:

- **Healthy leaves**  
- **Leaves with Early Blight disease**  
- **Leaves with Late Blight disease**

The goal of this project is to **develop an AI-powered system that can assist farmers and agricultural experts in detecting potato diseases through simple leaf images**, enabling early intervention and better crop management.
